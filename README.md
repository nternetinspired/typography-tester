<h1>Typography tester</h1>
<p>A single page of html used to test the typographical basics of your project. It should contain all the things your CSS will have to deal with. This will help you not forget to style them!</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Click on the README.md file above, the push the ‘Raw’ button (top right!). Copy and paste into your editor, or html project. Then just check your browser.</p>

<h1>Let's do this thing!</h1>
<p>This is the first paragraph (p tags yo!) in this section, so you can check the typographic styles of your project.<p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I found myself writing a selection of wacky type, usually within a CMS editor in my case, in order to visualise the typographic styles I was setting in a live environment. That shit gets boring eventually, so I decided to do this thing instead.</p>

<h2>Headings</h2>
<p>All the headings, for your delectation. Enjoy.</p>

<h1>h1</h1>
<p>h1, the most awesome of the headings.</p>
<p>Veritus torquatos per no, wisi pertinax dissentias id nec, eum ei summo veniam. Mei enim movet mediocritatem ex, vis cu denique percipitur. Vidisse nonumes ut cum, tacimates splendide te ius, eam ex quot vivendum platonem. Cu eirmod civibus apeirian his.</p>

<h2>h2</h2>
<p>h2, not quite so awesome but still pretty important as far as headings go.</p>
<p>Duo nulla accusata at, sed eu denique expetenda. Ne scaevola temporibus necessitatibus vis, liber gubergren signiferumque vis ea, eu eum mazim docendi abhorreant. Cotidieque definitiones duo ea, eu dico feugait nam. Mentitum disputando mel in, mei nobis fabellas adversarium at, ne pro dico noster.</p>

<h3>h3</h3>
<p>h3. About as low as I usually go down the ladder. Below h3? Why bother??</p>
</p>Eos ea hinc cetero ceteros, vocibus albucius te mei, debet invenire necessitatibus an usu. Cu harum dolor vim, quo eleifend temporibus ex, ut usu corpora corrumpit intellegat. Mel te purto constituto elaboraret, sanctus delicata id eam. Ut nec homero luptatum, pri ornatus urbanitas ut.</p>

<h4>h4</h4>
<p>h4. Really, that doesn't seem very important does it?</h4>
<p>Et munere habemus vis, in vis tota facilis, at affert munere tacimates vix. Dicit assentior qui ad, his debet eripuit convenire at, vix in nominavi theophrastus. Libris noster in pri, eum homero tacimates at. Imperdiet vulputate cu mea.</p>

<h5>h5</h5>
<p>Really, I've given up at this point.</p>
<p>Ut iisque nominavi antiopam his, at has utamur aperiri delicata, ne vis gubergren adipiscing. Id melius posidonium dissentias vis.</p>

<h6>h6</h6>
<p>Nothing to see here. h6? Are you trying to be funny?</p>

<h2>Phrase elements</h2>
<p>When I speak to people I don't know, I frequently place a <strong>strong</strong>, and often random, <em>emphasis</em> on certain words to creep them out.</p>
<p>If they are old enough to have have used dial-up modems I use <b>b tags</b> or, almost certainly random, <i>i tags</i> instead. That's how I roll.</p>

<h2>Quotes</h2>
<p>This is a paragraph with an <q>awesome inline quote using q tags</q>, the of type which I'd all but forgotten about. Does anyone use those?</p>

<blockquote>I like to quote my quotes in big shouty blockquote tags!</blockquote>

<p>And for the really fancy stuff:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I go nuts and to put paragraph tags inside the blockquotes!</p>
	<p>I'm a wild one!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And, as long as it's something I'm willing to admit to, I'll go as far as citing the quote with cite tags, thusly:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>I frequently surprise myself with the ease at which I can type random shit!</p>
	<cite>I said that, right here.</cite>
</blockquote>

<h2>Code</h2>
<p>If I want demo my l33t haxx0r skillz I'll</p>
<pre>Serve you my code inside pre tags</pre>
<p>Or even:</p>
<code>Lovely, semantic code tags!</code>
<p>If I'm feeling particularly retro, I might define the following as keyboard input (chuckle) using kbd tags:</p>
<kbd>$ma$h this cod3z in br0. M@d skillz. Beep.</kbd>


<h2>The other things</h2>
<p>If there are things I don't really want, or expect, you to read like all that legal junk <small>I'll hide all that inside small tags, so you know it isn't really important</small>, because I <strike>don't give a shit</strike> details matter.</p>
<mark>I might use mark tags to make things ugly.</mark>
<p>For definitions it's best to use the dfn tag, thusly:</p>
<dfn>Moron (mo·ron) - A person who'd write a whole page of this crap in order to check their typographical basics.</dfn>
